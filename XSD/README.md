**XSD Repository**

This repository contains the last XSD generated for store Non Dicom Data for Medirad Project. You can download the last version for build your own XML files and store all your datas. Be sure to have always the last version when you generate your XML.

A Version Number is integrated for each XSD on the second line and is in the tar.gz archive name.

We provide only an archive because this work is not intended to be written by every one, we need to follow the evolution, because semantic translator server need to be updated at the same time and because these XSD are too complex for being wiritten by a human because of redundancies.



**Tips for write your XML** :

Files paths in your XML have to be written from the repository where your XML file is, do not put the full path.

If you have a trouble use this website : https://www.xmlvalidation.com to see errors in your XML (Validate your XML againt the XSD schema used)

You can convert the XSD schema as functions with PyXB (Python) ou JaXB (Java) fou use it in your program.
